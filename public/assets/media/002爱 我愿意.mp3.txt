Episode 37
I will always be in your arms
You are my, you are my pearl
It's the sound of the flute
It's gentle and fragrant
With the power of love
I want to sing
My heart is no longer hidden
Completely hurt
I want to save love
In love, there is time
I wish you well
I wish you well
In love, there is time
I wish you well
You are my pearl
You are my pearl
I will always be in your arms
You are my, you are my pearl
I wish you well
In love, there is time
I wish you well
You are my pearl
You are my pearl
I will always be in your arms
You are my, you are my pearl
I will always be in your arms
You are my, you are my pearl
I will always be in your arms
